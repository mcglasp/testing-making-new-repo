# Absolutely Brilliant Website

Welcome! [Google](http://google.com)

This is the first README file I've created, or indeed opened. I've always wondered what they were for and now — I think — I know. I don't yet fully understand the need simplified HTML within the README however, so I'll need to recap on that.

This website, such as it is, uses HTML. I've tested it using Gitpod and GitHub. Git CLI was used to add, commit and push the files to GitHub.
